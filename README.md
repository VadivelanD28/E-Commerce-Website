# E-Commerce-Website
E-commerce websites allow people to buy and sell physical goods, services, and digital products over the Internet, rather than in a brick-and-mortar store. Through an e-commerce website, a business can process orders, receive payments, manage shipping and logistics, and provide customer service.
